## 🧮 Theory Background

### ⚛️ SSH Model and Edge States

The system consists of two coupled SSH chains with edge states described by:

- **Right edge state**: $|\psi_R\rangle = c_R(e^{-x/d_+} - e^{-x/d_-})|\phi\rangle$
- **Left edge state**: $|\psi_L\rangle = c_L(e^{x/\xi_+} - e^{x/\xi_-})|\phi\rangle$

Where the decay parameters are given by:
- $d_{\pm}^{-1} = \frac{|A|}{2m_2} \left(1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{4m_1m_2}{A^2}}\right)$
- $\xi_{\pm}^{-1} = \frac{|A'|}{2m_2'} \left(1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{4m_1'm_2'}{A'^2}}\right)$

### 🌊 Green's Function Approach

The coupled system is analyzed using the Dyson equation with a tunneling Hamiltonian:

$$\hat{V} = t(|\psi_R\rangle\langle\psi_L| + |\psi_L\rangle\langle\psi_R|)$$

The resulting Green's function for the right edge state is:

$$G_{RR}(x,\omega) = \frac{a(x)\omega^3}{\omega^4 - b(x)\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}b^2(x)}$$

Where:
- $a(x) = 2c_1^2[e^{-x/d_+} - e^{-x/d_-}]^2$
- $b(x) = 16t^2c_1^2c_2^2[e^{-x/d_+} - e^{-x/d_-}]^2[e^{x/\xi_+} - e^{x/\xi_-}]^2$

### 🔢 Normalization Constants

The normalization constants are calculated as:
- $c_1 = \frac{\sqrt{d_+ + d_-}}{|d_+ - d_-|}$
- $c_2 = \frac{\sqrt{\xi_+ + \xi_-}}{|\xi_+ - \xi_-|}$

## ⚙️ Code Functionality

### ✨ Main Features

1. **Parameter Calculation**: Computes all relevant physical parameters including decay lengths, normalization constants, and coupling terms.

2. **LDOS Computation**: Calculates the Local Density of States using the formula:
   $$\rho(\omega) = -\frac{1}{\pi} \text{Im}\{G(\omega + i\eta)\}$$
   where $\eta$ is a small imaginary part for analytical continuation.

3. **Visualization**: Generates multiple types of plots:
   - Static LDOS plots for different coupling strengths
   - Animated evolution showing the transition from uncoupled to strongly coupled regimes

4. **Parameter Studies**: Systematically varies the coupling parameter $t$ to study the evolution of the LDOS.

### 🎛️ Key Parameters

- **Physical Parameters**:
  - $w = 1.0$: Hopping amplitude
  - $a_{val} = 1.0$: Lattice parameter
  - $v = 0.8$: Intra-cell hopping
  - $x_{eval} = 0.5$: Evaluation position
  - $t$: Tunneling coupling strength (varied)

- **Numerical Parameters**:
  - $n = 5.0$: Frequency range $[-n, n]$
  - $m = 2000$: Number of discretization points
  - $\eta = 5\Delta\omega$: Imaginary part for analytical continuation

## 📊 Results Interpretation

The LDOS plots reveal several key physics:

- **$t = 0$**: Uncoupled system showing isolated edge state peaks
- **Small $t$**: Weak coupling regime with slight peak splitting
- **Intermediate $t$**: Hybridization of edge states becomes apparent
- **Large $t$**: Strong coupling regime with significant spectral weight redistribution

The animated evolution demonstrates the smooth transition between these regimes, providing insight into the nature of edge state coupling in topological systems.

## 🔧 Applications

This code is useful for:
- Understanding topological edge state physics
- Designing quantum devices with controlled edge state interactions
- Educational demonstrations of Green's function methods
- Research into coupled topological systems

## 🎓 Academic Context

This computational implementation was developed as part of the course Advanced Mathematical Physics as a final research project at the **National University of Colombia - Department of Physics**. The work investigates the local density of states (LDOS) for coupled topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains using Green's function methods, providing both analytical and numerical insights into edge state physics.

### 📊 Research Contributions

The study presents a comprehensive analysis of:

- **Single SSH Chain LDOS**: Analytical derivation confirming the existence of zero-energy edge states localized at boundaries, manifesting as Dirac delta peaks at ω = 0
- **Coupled System Dynamics**: Investigation of inter-chain tunneling effects that destroy zero-energy modes and create symmetric hybridized states
- **Symmetry Preservation**: Demonstration that chiral symmetry is maintained throughout the coupling evolution, ensuring symmetric peak distribution around the origin
- **Phase Transitions**: Systematic exploration of the transition from well-localized topological edge states to delocalized bulk resonances as coupling strength increases

### 🔬 Key Findings

The research reveals several important physical phenomena:

1. **Level Repulsion**: Weak coupling (t = 0.05) splits the zero-energy peak into two symmetric peaks due to protected level repulsion from chiral symmetry
2. **Progressive Hybridization**: Intermediate coupling strengths show peaks shifting away from ω = 0 with decreasing amplitudes, indicating partial delocalization
3. **Bulk Merger**: Strong coupling (t = 2) causes edge states to merge with the bulk continuum, creating broad, low-amplitude resonances
4. **Topological Robustness**: The evolution demonstrates both the robustness of edge states against weak perturbations and their eventual dissolution under strong interactions

This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of topological materials and provides valuable insights for designing quantum heterostructures and devices that exploit edge state interactions.

### 💡 Theoretical Context

The theoretical framework implemented in this code draws primarily from the SSH model [1] for understanding topological edge states, extended to coupled systems using Green's function methods. The LDOS calculation approach follows established quantum mechanical principles [5,6], while the physical motivation comes from both condensed matter [3] and photonic [4] realizations of topological systems. The study of coupled edge modes is particularly relevant for understanding Majorana fermions [2] and other exotic topological phases.
